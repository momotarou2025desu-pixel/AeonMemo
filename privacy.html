  <h1>Privacy Policy (Aeon Memo)</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2025-12-23</p>

  <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
  <p>Aeon Memo stores the notes you type <strong>locally on your device</strong>.</p>

  <h2>Advertising</h2>
  <p>This app may display ads in the future. When ads are enabled, an advertising SDK (for example, Google AdMob)
     may collect and process information such as device identifiers, IP address, approximate location, and ad interaction
     data to provide and measure ads, and to help prevent fraud.</p>
  <p>Data collected by the advertising provider is handled under that provider’s privacy policy.</p>

  <h2>How We Use Data</h2>
  <p>Your notes are used only to display, edit, and delete notes within the app.</p>

  <h2>Data Sharing / Transfer</h2>
  <p>Your notes are not uploaded to our servers. If ads are enabled, some data may be shared with the advertising provider
     as described above.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
  <p>Your notes remain on your device until you delete them or uninstall the app. Uninstalling the app removes the app’s local data.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>For privacy-related questions, please contact us via the GitHub repository Issues page.</p>
